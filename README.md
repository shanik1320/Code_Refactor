What I did with the html
    On the html file I had to make it a bit more simple and get rid of some of the div tags and be more specific it didn't change any part of the document but it made it more self explanatory
    I also eliminated a few classes and made it to one since they all had the same values in the style sheet.
    I also fixed the non-working links that way they are able to lead me to where they need to.
